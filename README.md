#Book Mart
Book Mart is a full-stack used-book marketplace built with a Go API and a React frontend. The project started as a Go learning exercise and now supports a complete marketplace flow: user signup, login, browsing listings, posting books for sale, viewing details, and checking out a book.

Stack
Go + Gorilla Mux for the API
React + React Router for the frontend
JWT authentication
Two storage modes:
local for file-backed development with no AWS setup
aws for the original DynamoDB + S3 integration
Project Structure
server/
main.go: starts the HTTP server with CORS enabled
router/router.go: registers API routes and static uploads
middleware/: request handlers for auth, products, selling, checkout, and errors
storage/local.go: local JSON-backed persistence for users and products
frontend/src/Components/
Login, SignIn, SignUp: auth flow
Products: marketplace home page with search, filters, and sorting
ProductDetails: single-book view
SellProduct: create a new listing
ProductCheckout: shipping form and purchase flow
Run Locally

server/uploads/
2. Start the frontend
cd frontend
copy .env.example .env
npm install
npm start
The frontend runs on http://localhost:3000.
